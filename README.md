# Foundry NFT
This project consists of 2 types of NFT's: a simple NFT and a dynamic NFT. And was built solely using foundry.

## Simplest way to create an NFT:
#### 1 - Upload an Image to IPFS
#### 2 - Upload json of NFT (with image linked) to IPFS
#### 3 - set the URI to link the NFT's json.
#### 4 - Mint the NFT with that URI
